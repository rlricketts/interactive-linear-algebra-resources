Rather this is a reference to a set of prolblems that apear in countless variontion throughout historical texts from around the world.  These problems usually involve purchasing some combination of 100 of a selection of objects, animals, etc. with 100 units of currency.  The trick being the varying costs of the objects and the requirement to be exact with the amount of currency used.</p>\n",

    "<p>Each of these problems lend themselves to finding solutions through linear algebra techniques.  Though the techniques we will use will be familiar we will find, that due to the constraints of the problems, we will have a solution set other than one, infinitely many, or none. This will provided us with a deeper understanding of the applications of the concepts we have been learning.</p>\n",
